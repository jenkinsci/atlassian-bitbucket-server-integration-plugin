    <p>When running a job, Jenkins will use these credentials to check out the source code for builds. For Jenkins to do
        this, it needs credentials with access to the projects and repositories you want it to build from.</p>

    <p>To provide Jenkins with credentials you can:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>choose credentials from the list</li>
        <li>add credentials as a <strong>Username with password</strong> (for the password, you can enter a Bitbucket Server password or a
            Bitbucket Server <a href="https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/a97-Nw">personal access token</a>)
        </li>
        <li>Leave this empty to use default credentials if they exist.</li>
    </ul>
