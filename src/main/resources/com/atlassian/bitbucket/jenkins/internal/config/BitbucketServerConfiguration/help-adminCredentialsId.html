    <p>Choose a Bitbucket Server <a
            href="https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/BitbucketServer/Personal+access+tokens">personal
        access token</a> with project admin permissions for the projects that you want Jenkins to build from. If you
        can't find a suitable token in the list, you can add one. The token you add must be a <strong>Bitbucket personal access token</strong></p>

    <p>Providing this token will allow your users to automatically set up build triggers when creating Jenkins jobs.
        They won't be able to use it for anything else. </p>
