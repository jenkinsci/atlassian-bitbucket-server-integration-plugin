    <p>When running a job, Jenkins uses credentials to check out the source code for builds. You can provide Jenkins
        with credentials here, or your users can provide them when creating a Jenkins job.</p>

    <p>Of these options, we recommend providing credentials here. Doing this makes it easier for users to create jobs.
        Instead of having to add their own credentials, they can choose from the ones you have added. To make job
        creation even easier, the credentials you choose here will also be selected for them by default.</p>

    <p>Credentials must be added as a <strong>Username with password.</strong></p>
