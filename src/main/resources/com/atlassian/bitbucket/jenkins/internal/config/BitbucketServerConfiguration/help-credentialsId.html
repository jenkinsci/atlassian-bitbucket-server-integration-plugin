    <p>Adding credentials makes it easier for users to set up Jenkins projects. Users can select from the credentials
        you add to allow Jenkins to authenticate with Bitbucket and retrieve their projects. You can add credentials in
        the form of a 'username with password', or a personal access token as 'secret text'.</p>

    <p>It's not mandatory to add credentials. If you choose not to, users will be able to add their own when setting up a
        project.</p>
