    Adding Bitbucket project-access credentials is not mandatory, but it makes it easier for users to set up Jenkins projects.<br><br>
    Project-access credentials allow Jenkins to authenticate with a Bitbucket instance and retrieve the projects on it.
    They will be able to select and use them to give Jenkins access to their project.<br><br>
    If you don't add credentials users will be able to add their own when setting up a project.<br><br>
    When adding credentials only add a 'username with password'; or a personal access token as 'secret text'.<br><br>
