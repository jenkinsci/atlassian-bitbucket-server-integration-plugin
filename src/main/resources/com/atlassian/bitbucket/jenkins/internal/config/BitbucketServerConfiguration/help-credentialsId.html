    <p>Adding credentials makes it easier for users to set up Jenkins projects. Users will be able to choose from these
        credentials to allow Jenkins to authenticate with Bitbucket and retrieve their projects. You should add
        credentials in the form of a 'username with password'.</p>

    <p>It's not mandatory to add credentials. If you choose not to users will be able to add their own when setting up a
        project.</p>
