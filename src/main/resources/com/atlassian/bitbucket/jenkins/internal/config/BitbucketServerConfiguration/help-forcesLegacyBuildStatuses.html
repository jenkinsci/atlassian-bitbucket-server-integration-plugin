    <p>
        This option tells Jenkins not to send enriched build statuses to this Bitbucket Server instance. The rich
        build status feature can be disabled if you are experiencing issues with the way build statuses are being
        displayed in Bitbucket Server 7.4 or above.
    </p>
    <p>
        This option will have no effect if Bitbucket Server is below version 7.4.
