        tokens</a> are generated in Bitbucket Server. The token you add must have project admin permissions
        for the projects that you want Jenkins to build from.</p>

    <p>Providing this token will allow your users to automatically set up build triggers when creating Jenkins jobs.
        They won't be able to use it for anything else.</p>
