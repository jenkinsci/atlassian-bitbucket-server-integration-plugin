    Credentials are required for Jenkins to authenticate with Bitbucket. Depending on the credentials used, they give Jenkins
    access to some or all of the repositories on your Bitbucket instance, and allow it to create builds. To provide them:<br>
    1. Select credentials for your instance from the dropdown list (if they exist)<br>
    2. Add your own credentials for your instance<br>
    The credentials you provide will determine which Bitbucket instances appear below.
