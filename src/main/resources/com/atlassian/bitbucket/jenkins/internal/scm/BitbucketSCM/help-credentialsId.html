    <p>Jenkins requires credentials to authenticate with Bitbucket. They give Jenkins access to some or all of the repositories on your Bitbucket instance and allow it to check out source code for building.
        Here you can:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>use the dropdown list to select the credentials you want Jenkins to use, or</li>
        <li>leave 'none' selected to use the instance defined credentials (if they exist).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The credentials you use will determine which projects and repositories Jenkins can clone.</p>
