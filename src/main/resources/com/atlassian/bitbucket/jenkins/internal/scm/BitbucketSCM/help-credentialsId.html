    <p>When running a job, Jenkins requires credentials to checkout the source code for builds. To do this, it needs credentials with access to the projects and repositories you want it to build from.</p>
    <p>You can provide Jenkins with credentials here by:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>selecting credentials from the list</li>
        <li>adding credentials as a <strong>Username with password</strong> (for the password, you can enter a Bitbucket Server password or a
            Bitbucket Server <a href="https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/a97-Nw">personal access token</a>)
        </li>
        <li>leaving this empty to use default credentials if they exist</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Alternatively, you can provide Jenkins with SSH credentials below. If you do this, Jenkins will use your SSH credentials instead by default.</p>
