    <p>When running a job, Jenkins requires credentials to authenticate with Bitbucket Server. For example, to checkout the source code for builds. To do this, it needs credentials with access to the projects and repositories you want it to build from.</p>
    <p>You can provide Jenkins with credentials here by:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>selecting credentials from the list</li>
        <li>adding credentials as a <strong>Username with password</strong> (for the password, you can enter a Bitbucket Server password or a Bitbucket Server <a href="https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/a97-Nw">personal access token</a>)
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>In addition, you can provide Jenkins with SSH credentials below. If you do, Jenkins will use them for clone operations instead of the credentials you select here.</p>
