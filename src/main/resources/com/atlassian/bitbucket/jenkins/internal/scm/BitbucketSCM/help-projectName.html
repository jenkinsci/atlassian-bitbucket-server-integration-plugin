        Type the project name to search for available projects, and then select one from the list.

        If your project does not appear in the result list, then it is possible that the selected credentials do not
        have read permission to the project.

        If you're trying to configure a personal repository, the project will not appear in the search results. Please
        use a tilde (<code>~</code>) followed by the username of the user whose personal repository you're trying
        to configure. For instance if their username was <code>jsmith</code> use <code>~jsmith</code> here.
