    <p>Enter the Bitbucket Server repository you want Jenkins to build from. To find a repository, start typing. If it doesn't appear in the search results, the credentials that you've chosen may not have read access to it and you'll need to provide different credentials.</p>

    <p>To get Jenkins to build from a personal repository, enter its slug. This is the URL-friendly version of the
        repository name. For example, a repository called my example repo will have the slug <em>my-example-repo</em>, and you
        can see this in its URL, https://bitbucketserver.mycompany.com/myproject/my-example-repo.</p>
