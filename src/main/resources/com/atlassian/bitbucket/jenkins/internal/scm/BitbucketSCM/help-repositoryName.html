        Type the repository name to search for available repositories in the chosen project, and then select one from
        the list.
    </p>
    <p>
        If your repository does not appear in the result list, then it is possible that the selected credentials to not
        have read access to the repository.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you're trying to configure a personal repository, it will not appear in the search results. Please use the
        repository slug as the repository name in this case. The slug is the URL-friendly version of the repository
        name. For example, the repository 'My example repo' might have the URL
        <em>'https://bitbucketserver-url.com/teamsinspace/my-example-repo'</em>, so the slug is
        <em>'my-example-repo'</em>.
